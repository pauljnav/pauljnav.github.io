# PesterUtility
PesterUtility is a module of mine containing utility functions that assist when Pester testing
So far I have just the one function `Get-FunctionNamesFromScript.ps1` in the module.


### Get-FunctionNamesFromScript.ps1 module
Tthe module is defined with well documented help, and examples.
Its purpose is to extaextract function and filter names from a PowerShell script/module. And I get to use it to verify and at times modify the `Export-ModuleMember` command is correct in my module definition.
